# Pages

One core feature of Nuxt is the file system router. Every Vue file inside the `pages/` directory creates a corresponding URL (or route) that displays the contents of the file. By using dynamic imports for each page, Nuxt leverages code-splitting to ship the minimum amount of JavaScript for the requested route.
