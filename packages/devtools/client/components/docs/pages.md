# Pages

Nuxt provides a file-based routing to create routes within your web application using Vue Router under the hood. Pages are Vue components and can have any valid extension that Nuxt supports (by default .vue, .js, .jsx, .mjs, .ts or .tsx). Nuxt will automatically create a route for every page in your `~/pages/` directory.

# Middlewares

Nuxt provides a customizable route middleware framework that can be used throughout the application. This is ideal for extracting code that needs to run before navigating to a particular route.
