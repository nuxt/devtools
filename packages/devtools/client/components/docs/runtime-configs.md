# Runtime Configs

Nuxt provides a runtime config API to expose configuration within your application and server routes, with the ability to update it at runtime by setting environment variables.

In Nuxt DevTools, the editor allows you to edit the runtime config temporarily to see how the changes affect your application. To update them, you might want to update your `nuxt.config.js` file, or check more details in the documentation.
