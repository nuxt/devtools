# Components
Vue Components allow us to split the UI into independent and reusable pieces, and think about each piece in isolation. This is very similar to how we nest native HTML elements, but Vue implements its own component model that allow us to encapsulate custom content and logic in each component.

Components placed in the `components/` directory are automatically registered by nuxt. They can be used in your templates without importing them.
