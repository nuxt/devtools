# Plugins

Nuxt plugins allow you to extend the functionality of the Nuxt runtime and the Vue instance. You can add plugins to the `plugins/` directory and they will be automatically imported and registered.

<HelpTipPerformance>
Plugins always run before your application's runtime. The loading time of each plugin will directly impact your application's initial loading time.
