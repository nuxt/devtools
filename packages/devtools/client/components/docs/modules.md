# Modules

Nuxt provides a module system to extend the framework core and simplify integrations. You don't need to develop everything from scratch or maintain boilerplate if there is already a Nuxt module for it. Adding Nuxt modules is possible using `nuxt.config`.

You can explore the list of modules on [nuxt.com/modules](https://nuxt.com/modules) or install them directly inside the DevTools.
