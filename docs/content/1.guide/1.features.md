## VS Code Server

The VS Code Server integration in Nuxt DevTools enhances your development experience by bringing the power of Visual Studio Code directly into your browser. With this feature, you can seamlessly edit and debug your Nuxt projects using the familiar interface of VS Code.

Nuxt DevTools supports the following ways of integrating with VS Code:

### Connecting to an existing code-server instance

Set `reuseExistingServer` to true in runtime config for `devtools/vscode` and set the `port` option to specify a port (defalts to 3080):

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  devtools: {
    vscode: {
      reuseExistingServer: true,
      port: 3090
    }
  }
})
```

### Running a code-server instance locally

You can use either the [Microsoft Visual Studio Code Server](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/vscode-server) (via the `code` or `code-server` cli tools) or the [Coder VS Code Server](https://coder.com/docs/code-server/latest/install) (via the `code-server` cli tool) by setting the `codeServer` parameter under `devtools/vscode` in the runtime configuration.

Options for the codeServer parameter are:
|Type|Option|
|----|------|
|MS Code CLI|`ms-code-cli`|
|MS Code Server|`ms-code-server`|
|Coder Code Server|`coder-code-server`|

You can set the `port` parameter to listen on a specific port (default 3080) and you can set the `host` parameter if you need to listen on a particular host interface (useful for devcontainers or docker containers that listen on ipv6 by default).

**Example**:

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  devtools: {
    vscode: {
      codeServer: 'ms-code-server',
      host: '0.0.0.0',
      port: 3090
    }
  }
})
```

### Remotely via a MS VS Code server tunnel

Set the `mode` option in `devtools/vscode` runtime configuration to `tunnel`. You can set the name of the tunnel to connect to using the `tunnel` option under `devtools/vscode/tunnel` in runtime configuration)

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  devtools: {
    vscode: {
      mode: 'tunnel',
      tunnel: {
        name: 'my-tunnel-name'
      }
    }
  }
})
```

### Code Server Installation Instructions

To get started with Microsoft VS Code Server, follow the installation instructions provided by [Microsoft Visual Studio Code Server](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/vscode-server)

To get started with Coder Code Server, follow the installation instructions provided by [Code Server Installation Guide](https://coder.com/docs/code-server/latest/install)
